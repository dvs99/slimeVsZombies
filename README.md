# Slime vs Zombies
Game developed using the Phaser framework as the final project of the course 'Web Game Design and Development ' in collaboration with Alexandra Moreno Díaz and Cristian Cantos Roselló.
You can play it [here](https://dvs99.github.io/slimeVsZombies/).
# How to play
### Levels 1 and 2
You´ll have to get all the candies before the time runs out or you will get killed. Rotate the character by moving the **mouse** and move forward by holding and releasing
the **right mouse button**. In level two you can also shoot with the **left mouse button** or with **spacebar**. Please note that due to a current bug you may need to move the
mouse out of the game viewport and back in for it to work. When you get the candies, you will have to go through the rainbow door that takes you to the next level or
to the final screen. Objects that can hurt you are green and the ones which can´t hurt are pink. There are three ground types, the green ground makes you go slower,
the ice ground makes you go faster. The normal ground has no effect. There are two power-ups, the shield (press **X key** to use it), which will protect you from
everything, and the hammer (press **Z key** to use it) that will hit the ground and kill enemies that are nearby.
### Level 3
This level plays like a platformer. Move using the **arrow keys** and shoot using **spacebar**. The rest of the game works the same than the other two levels except for
a new ground type that makes you jump higher.

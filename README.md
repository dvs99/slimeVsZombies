## How to play
You have to get all the candies before the time runs out or you will get killed. For levels 1 and 2 rotate the character by *moving the mouse* and move forward by *holding and releasing the right mouse button*. In level two you can shoot with the *left mouse button* or with *spacebar*. Please note that due to a current bug you may need to move the mouse out of the game viewport and back in for it to work. When you get the candies, you will have to go through the rainbow door that takes you to the next level or to the final screen. Objects that can hurt you are green and the ones which can´t hurt are pink. There are three ground types, the green ground makes you go slower, the ice ground makes you go faster. The normal ground has no effect. There are two power-ups, the shield (press *X key* to use it), which will protect you from everything, and the hammer (press *Z key* to use it) that will hit the ground and kill enemies that are nearby. Level 3 plays like a platformer, move using the arrow keys and shoot using spacebar. It also includes a new ground type that makes you jump higher.
